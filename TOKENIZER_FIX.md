# Tokenizer Fix Summary

## Problem
Model was generating malformed FOPL like:
```
forall ( x ) & forall ( y ) -> forall ( x , due_date <= 5 )
```

Instead of:
```
forall x (ServiceProvider(x) -> CompleteMaintenance(x, deadline <= 30))
```

## Root Cause
- **84% of predicates** (174 out of 207) were being split into multiple subword tokens
- Example: `PerformanceReview` → `▁Performance | Re | view` (3 tokens)
- Model couldn't learn to generate multi-token predicates reliably

## Solution Applied
✅ Extracted all 180 unique predicates from dataset
✅ Added them to tokenizer vocabulary as single tokens
✅ Added 15 FOPL operators (`forall`, `->`, `<=`, etc.)
✅ Updated `models/neural_parser.py` to auto-load predicates

## Files Changed
- `models/neural_parser.py` - Enhanced tokenizer initialization
- `extract_predicates.py` - Script to extract predicates
- `data/predicates.txt` - List of all predicates
- `data/predicates.py` - Python format for easy import

## Results
**Before:**
- `ServiceProvider` → 4 tokens: `▁Service | Pro | vid | er`
- `CompleteMaintenance` → 5 tokens: `▁Complete | Mai | nt | en | ance`

**After:**
- `ServiceProvider` → 1 token: `ServiceProvider` ✅
- `CompleteMaintenance` → 1 token: `CompleteMaintenance` ✅

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Retrain on Kaggle with enhanced tokenizer (10-15 epochs)
3. Expected improvement: 54% → 95%+ exact match

## Why This Works
- Fewer tokens = easier for model to learn
- Single-token predicates = atomic units the model can directly generate
- No more trying to assemble 3-6 subwords into predicate names

**Before retraining, verify tokenizer works:**
```python
from models.neural_parser import NeuralLegalParser
parser = NeuralLegalParser(model_name="t5-base")
# Should show: "✅ Added 184 new tokens to vocabulary"
```
